//HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS -> forEach, maop, filter, reduce, sort
//a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function as a result is called a higher order function
//forEach -> executes a provided function once for each array element
//map -> creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array
//filter -> creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function
//reduce -> executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value
//callback function -> a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed inside that function
